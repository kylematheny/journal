# Learn the Language

Before you start coding, take the time to learn the language. If you're using 
a language such as JavaScript, become an expert in prototypal inheritence. If 
you're about to write Java, learn the ways of Object-Oriented Programming -- 
Haskell? Learn the ways of Functional Programming.
